							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/phonebook.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>This is a Python programming challenge to assess the ability to design an algorithm to solve a problem. The first part of the assignment consisted in choosing the application
								to develop during the assignment and define the objective and purpose of the selected application, outline the instructions of how the application is to be executed, define and
								show the data structures used in the application, describe the algorithms using pseudocode, identify the checkpoints to test and outline a test plan indicating the range of data 
								that will be used and outline the expected test results.
							</p>
							<p>The second part of the assignment focuses on developing a Python program to fulfil the functionalities of the application choose in the first part of the assignment. The application
								has an interface designed to enable the user to:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li> Enter at least five records</a></li>
								<li> Delete and search records based on keyword/string entry</a></li>
								<li> Sort records in a specific order and display them on screen</a></li>
								<li> Select an option on the screen to perform a function</a></li>
								<li> Get a prompt on screen before an action is performed</a></li>
							</ul>

						<h4>Feedback Assignment part one</h4>
						<p>You identified the right answers and explained well. However, in some instances, you could explain your diagrams or pseudocode better and represent your steps in text e.g. give more details about the next steps etc. 
							In general the testing plan could include more details and discussions e.g. include some references to support your arguments.
							Overall a very good report organisation. Very good use of diagrams to demonstrate algorithms. Better discussion of datastructures, some extra elaboration on the reasons to use it, it could also add value (e.g. using references).</p>
						<p>Grade: 66% (Merit)</p>

						<h4>Feedback Assignment part two</h4>
						<p>Overall a very good effort. Well documented assignment with examples and test cases. Good logic using for and if loop, comments are used to explain and outputs are shown. 
							Code could be better in terms of implementation and use of functionalities.
							The report could be further extended to include more discussions and analysis. 
							Good strategy is taken to implement the logic. Test strategy could be described in detail and comments are used. List positioning using list indexing has been used correctly. Test results are correct.
							Overall the coding could be better in terms of using more libraries and Python data structures.
							Code implements the correct logic, good use of for and if. Variables are defined correctly. </p>
