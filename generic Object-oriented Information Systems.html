						<h4>Mid module assignment: System Design</h4>
						<p class="ex2">In unit 7 I had to submit a mid-module assignment on the topic of system design. For this assignment I had to design a new software system to manage self-service checkouts of an high street supermarket chain. 
							In addition to drawing a class diagram, I wrote a report explaining the list of classes used in the system design, the reasons why I included them and the list of relationships between them.</p>
							
						<p class="ex2">To successfully create this system design I applied the skills acquired during previous weeks and put in practice the concepts of object-oriented design and UML.
							I think I was able to build a good system design because I put a lot of thoughts into what kind of attributes and methods each class would have. In particular, I put a lot of effort into choosing the appropriate relationship between classes.
							Moreover, I think the design was well thought through based on the feedback received from the course tutor who highlighted the high level of granularity without the system design being disjointed, appropriate use of the chosen relationships, good use of names and multiplicities, and a good level of detail and appropriate use of notation.</p>

						<h4>System implementation</h4>
						<p class="ex2">In unit 11 I submitted the second assignment of this module as part of which I had to implement an object-oriented system. I had to implement a system design of a local doctor's surgery using Python.

							I paid a lot of attention to identifying the correct and appropriate use of relationships between classes in Python. If I could redo the assignment, I would create a more extensive system implementation by adding a GUI and using SQL databases. Despite this I believe the proposed system implementation met the requirements of the assignment.</p>
						<p class="ex2">The feedback from the tutor suggested to continue working on my Python skills to create more effective and lean code. Moreover, I am planning to practice more the testing phase by implementing unit testing or similar tools.</p>

								<h2>Reflections on the module</h2>
								<p></p>
							</header>
							<p class="ex2">The twelve-week module Object-Oriented Information Systems gave me the opportunity to expand my knowledge and acquire new skills in a core area of computer science and programming. This report presents my reflections on this module. The layout follows the timeline of the course, with a more general section on my personal learnings at the end.</p>
							<p class="ex2">The focus in the first weeks of the module was on information systems and in particular why they are important and the kind of problems that can be caused by poor information system planning. During the first three weeks, I participated in a collaborative discussion with other students about the identification of information system failures and what caused them. I presented a case study on the AU$ 1.2 billion Queensland Health payroll scandal.
								The activity allowed me to understand the importance of defining the structure and requirements of information systems, and the severity of problems that poor planning can cause.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p class="ex2">After information systems, the focus of the module shifted to object-oriented design. I realised how useful this approach is to designing software by utilising data structures with their own characteristics and methods. I found it particularly interesting working with UML because it was the first time I applied this modelling language and had the opportunity to use dedicated drawing tools. I had to opportunity to practice using UML by creating a system design representing a supermarket IT system.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p class="ex2"> The activity helped me to gain a good understanding of how to approach the mid-module assignment of unit 7, which involved creating a system design to manage self-service checkouts of a supermarket chain. I particularly enjoyed this activity because I could put the knowledge acquired in previous weeks to good use. It was challenging yet satisfying to identify the right concepts to represent the appropriate relationships between classes, e.g. inheritance, aggregation, and composition.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p class="ex2">I stated to use object-oriented programming in my profession when working on several projects. Instead of working on the project as a whole, I analyse the scope of the project I want to implement, and destructure it into a series of tasks, which can be compared to system design classes. This has helped me having better control when unexpected changes occur or when I have to delegate tasks to other team members.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p class="ex2">In Unit 7 I was introduced to an interesting topic: database design and normalization. The latter helps structuring a relational database in order to avoid data redundancy and achieve better data integrity. As part of this unit, I participated in a formative activity where I had to normalise a set of tables to conform to the third normal form (3NF). I had to analyse the structure of two supplied tables and think about how to logically separate the data into further tables as well as choose the appropriate primary and foreign keys.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p class="ex2">After completing this activity, I created an entity relationship diagram (ERD) to showcase how the different tables related to each other. This activity helped me to better understand how databased are structured in my company and how the Quality Assurance Analysts are using them. Since I looked into this topic, I started working more with databases at work and in particular with SQL, which I am enjoying working with.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p class="ex2">During the next three units, I was involved in the second collaborative discussion of this module, which was on the use of NoSQL technologies. More specifically, I had to choose a NoSQL technology, describe its key approaches and how it compares to a traditional relational database.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p class="ex2">For the discussion I decided to investigate key/value databases and how they differ from relational databases. I found it extremely interesting how organisations still commonly use relational databases despite their considerable disadvantages and the increasing prevalence of NoSQL technologies. Key/value databases are ideal for fast lookups and 
								when used for forums or online shopping websites. For organisations such as the one I am working for, SQL remains the better solution because it provides custom views of the data and and the use of specific ad-hoc queries which are fundamental for the queries and data drill-down our analysts perform on a daily basis.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p class="ex2">As part of unit 11, I submitted the second module assignment, which was on system implementation (specifically, of an object-oriented system). I was supplied with a system design I had to implement using Python.
								For this activity, I spent quite a bit of time understanding how to implement the appropriate relationships between classes and how to do this with Python. As I have started to use Python only in the last twelve months, I was keen to expand my knowledge of certain concepts, functionality and libraries. For this reason, I conducted additional research to implement the object-oriented system required for this assignment. </p>
							<p></p>
							<p class="ex2">In addition to improving my programming skills, the assignment helped me improving my time management skills. I had to maximise my time after work to study as much as possible, write and test the code I prepared for the assignment, and be present at home to help my wife with our newborn daughter who was born only a couple of weeks prior.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p class="ex2">When I started the module I had a limited understanding of object-oriented information systems. Now I feel confident I have a good grasp of its concepts and have benefited from its use in my day-to-day work.
							I also found interesting creating an ERD and learning about and applying normalisation to a relational database. This has helped me having a better understanding of the usage of databases in my company.
							At the end of this module, I am planning to expand and improve my Python coding skills further and in particular how to better implement certain kind of relationships between classes when implementing a system.</p>
