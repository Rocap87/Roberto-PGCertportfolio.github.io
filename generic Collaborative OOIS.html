							<p>In this page are included the two collaborative discussions of the module Object-oriented Information System. The first collaborative discussion focuses on the identification of information system failures and what caused them. The second discussion is about the use of NoSQL technologies. More specifically, I choose a NoSQL technology and describe its key approaches and how it compares to a traditional relational database.

							<h4>Collaborative discussion Unit 1 - 3</h4>
							<p>Information systems are used in our society to allow people to perform a wide range of activities and their application have become essential in many sectors. The widespread use of information systems and their increasing complexity have led to reliability issues and failures (Kobayashi, 2018).</p>
							<p>A relevant example of an information system failure is the Queensland Health payroll scandal which cost AU$ 1.2 billion to the Queensland taxpayers. In 2002 the Queensland Government established the Shared Services Initiative (SSI) with the intent to rationalise and offer higher standards of government services with a considerable reduction in their costs. In 2003, the SSI established that the different departments of the Queensland Government, including Queensland Health, have to replace their payroll systems and adopt a standard software solution. (Tony Moore, 15 August 2013).
							<p>In 2006 Queensland Health was notified by the payroll system provider that their software would become obsolete by mid-2008. For this reason, they had to implement a new software earlier than planned and in 2007 IBM was awarded with a AU$98 million contract to develop the new payroll system. In October 2008 it transpired that IBM was not able to fulfil the performance criteria of supplying a new IT system for the whole government and revised the estimate of AU$98 million to a total cost of AU$181 million to roll out the new system (Mark Ludlow, 21 December 2016).</p>
								The idea of supplying a new IT system for the whole Queensland Government was scrapped and it was decided to continue with IBM just for a new payroll system designed for Queensland Health, which went live only in March 2010 after several aborted attempts. When the new payroll system went live, 78,000 Queensland Health staff were overpaid, underpaid or not paid at all. (Tony Moore, 15 August 2013).
								The result of this series of errors led the Queensland Government to assign 1000 employees to manually process payslips for Queensland Health workers and chase front-line health staff to get them to repay the overpayments. The new Queensland government elected in 2012 estimated that it would take eight years to fix the payroll system and cost a total of AU$ 1.2 billion (Mark Ludlow, 21 December 2016).</p>
							<p>At the end of July 2013, Richard Chesterman published the Queensland Health Payroll System Commission of Inquiry Report (2013) which included findings from a three-months investigation into the matter. It underlined the multiple factors that lead to this failure such as:
								Queensland Government failed to communicate to IBM the business requirements for the workforce of Queensland Health and this brought IBM to fail in design an appropriate payroll system to accommodate the complexity of pay rules. 
								IBM did not actively request information about the necessary requirements to design an appropriate system for Queensland Health.
								When the system went live, it had a series of deficiencies that lead to Queensland Health staff not receiving the accurate salary or not being paid at all.
								Queensland Government decided to give the contract to IBM Australia based on their cheaper offer in comparison to other organizations which took part in the bid. Unfortunately, the government did not consider that this was the first time IBM Australia was involved in a project of this size.</p>

								<h4>Collaborative discussion Unit 8 - 10</h4>
							<p>The increasing amount of data led to the problem of scalability issues of the relational databases and consequentially were developed NoSQL databases (Nayak et al., 2013). The majority of the NoSQL databases have an high horizontal scalability and does not rely highly available hardware (Strauch et al., 2011).
								NoSQL databases offer an high scalability because the data stored is redundant and more decentralized (Haas, N., 2022)
								The key-value database is one of the NoSQL database technologies widely used in these days.
								The data stored in such databases consists of two parts: a string representing the key and the actual data representing the value. The main characteristic that makes these kind of databases faster than relational databases is that the data is stored similarly to hash tables and the keys used as indexes (Strauch et al., 2011).
								This kind of databases give the opportunity to obtain fast lookups, the data has high scalability but ad-hoc querying and analytics features have been omitted and for this reason it is difficult to create custom views of the data.
								 
								<p>The key-value databases are widely used in forums, online shopping websites where can be used to store user sessions and shopping carts. One of the NoSQL largely used is the DynamoDB developed by Amazon (Strauch et al., 2011).</p>
								
								<p>NoSQL systems have data distributed on across many storage nodes and in the case of Oracle this is used to create replication nodes organised in shards which permit a faster read throughput but on the other hand having more replication cause a slower writing time in the database because more data needs to be copied(Allen, R., 2022).</p>
								
								<p>When dealing with large dataset the obvious choice is to use NoSQL databases because of its high horizontal scalability; instead in case of smaller databases it is recommended to use SQL which gives the opportunity to have custom views and use specific ad hoc querying and analytics such as joins and aggregate operations.</p>
