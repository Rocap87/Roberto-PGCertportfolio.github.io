						<h4>Development Team Project: Design Document and Coding Output</h4>
						<p class="ex2">In unit 6 my team Defense in Depth had to submit a design document for the application we were going to present in unit 11. We decided to build an app for the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) of the Dutch government to manage cases of suspected Internet crime in accordance with the national counterterrorism and cybersecurity policy.</p>
							
						<p class="ex2">To write the proposal I read a lot about the NCSC and how GDPR is applied when there is a criminal investigation and consulted OWASP to define the security requirements of our app. I also created a use case diagram showing how the different stakeholders of our application would interact.</p>
						<p class="ex2">While writing the document, I used the skills I acquired in the previous weeks, in the module “Object-oriented Design” and UML to create the use case diagram.</p>
						<p class="ex2">I believe our coding output reflects well what we outlined in our proposal submitted in unit 6. The high level of collaboration within our team was fundamental to achieve the desired results and fulfil all the requirements of this assignment. The tutor feedback proved that our efforts paid off – the tutor highlighted how an excellent range of security-related capabilities had been deployed and verified as being operational through automated testing.</p>

								<h2>Reflections on the teamwork</h2>
								<p></p>
							</header>
							<p class="ex2">The teamwork activity was the core activity of this module, which I found to be a really positive experience. Establishing clear roles and responsibilities in our team from the outset helped instilling a highly collaborative attitude among the team and a shared desire to succeed in the activity.</p>
							<a href="https://github.com/Rocap87/SSD-documents/blob/main/SSD%20documents/Defense%20in%20depth_team%20contract.pdf" class="title">Team contract</a>
							<p></p>
							<p class="ex2">During the course of the module we met every Monday afternoon and we actively communicated with each other via Slack almost on a daily basis. This meant we could keep each other updated on the progress of our tasks and review the pieces of work we were going to submit.</p>

							<p></p>
							<p class="ex2">I mainly contributed in writing, reviewing the design document and realising the use case diagram illustrated in
								<a href="https://github.com/Rocap87/SSD-documents/blob/main/SSD%20documents/Project%20proposal%20-%20SSD.pdf" class="title">page 13.</a>
								When the focus shifted on writing the coding output I focused on writing the validation scripts for our app and the comments on the code.
							Proof of my coding contribution is captured in the
							<a href="https://github.com/Rocap87/SSD-team-project/blob/main/README.md" class="title">coding output readme file</a>
